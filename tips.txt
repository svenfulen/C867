If you don't know where to start with this project, just start coding the Student class first.  It is the easiest part of the project to put together.

I copied the project requirements into a Word document, and cut out the parts that I didn't need to figure out what I needed to code.

Write your classes in pseudo-code first, so you understand exactly what you're trying to do before writing the function.

It helps a lot to collaborate with others when trying to figure out difficult problems.  Try to connect with someone that is working on the same project.
(Thank you to Pi for helping me fix my code)

If you know how to use Git, definitely use it for version control.  If you completely mess up all your code, you can just roll back to the previous version.

As a beginner, this program was really hard to write, and it took me about a month of learning C++ concepts and 2 weeks of coding to finish.
When you finish this project, you'll have a really good understanding of programming concepts, and you'll be better at coding.
