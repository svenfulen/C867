This is my full project for WGU course C867.

This application is built around parsing and manipulating data from an input string, and storing them in objects.  There are 2 classes in the project.

The Roster class includes functions to manipulate, parse, and store data.

I haven't found anywhere that says I cannot share my work, so I'm putting it on here to help other students structure their code.
I've put plenty of comments and cleaned this code up to make it readable, so you can see more clearly what each function does.
Please do not just copy-paste anything from this project, you can learn more by finding ways to implement some of this code yourself.

P.S. there are definitely much better ways to do some of these functions than I have done.  If you see something in my code that could be improved, please make a branch and improve it so others can see.
